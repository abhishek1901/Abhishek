Stocks that investors think are understimated are invested into as market influences (Market Overreacts to such stocks) cause prominent fluctuations in their values. Buy/Sell opportunities can be realised from such fluctuations.  \n","\n","Several KPIs are considered to identify such underestimated stocks.But relevant KPIs are specific to the kind of stock we deal with. Hence, for a complete index selecting KPIs becomes a little tricky.\n","\n","In order to address to the relevancy concerns of the KPIs, we consider the aggregate indications of the following metrics (Lowest Average of the Percentiles of the metrics for each stock):\n","* Price-to-earnings ratio\n","* Price-to-book ratio\n","* Price-to-sales ratio\n","* Enterprise Value to EBITDA\n","* Enterprise
